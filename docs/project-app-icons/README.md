# App icon switching

Bundled icon choices for the native SpecDown shells. The original remains the default.

## Try it

- macOS: **Appearance → Dock Icon**. Changes the running Dock icon and restores the selection on launch. Finder and the signed application bundle retain the shipped icon.
- Windows/Linux: **Appearance → Window Icon**. Changes the running window icon; installed shortcuts retain the shipped icon.
- iPhone: **App Icon** on the welcome screen or **More → App Icon** while viewing a file.
- iPad: **Appearance → App Icon** in the sidebar (compact layouts also have the iPhone entry points).
- Choose **Original** to reset. iOS persists its selection through `UIApplication`; desktop stores `appIcon` in its existing state file.

The desktop uses bundled PNGs in `desktop/icons`, already covered by electron-builder's `desktop/**/*` packaging glob. iOS uses six alternate AppIcon catalogs declared in `ios/project.yml`; Xcode generates both phone and iPad alternate-icon metadata. Icons must be bundled at build time on iOS. No downloads, arbitrary file paths, or document-controlled icon changes are supported.

## Artwork

The six concepts use versioned 1254-pixel masters in `build/app-icon-sources`.
Desktop uses transparent PNG exports; iOS uses opaque navy-backed exports.
All alternatives match Original's 824-pixel maximum visible dimension on a
1024-pixel canvas, centered without stretching. The exporter removes extraction
fringes and stray low-opacity pixels. See the source folder's README for rebuild
instructions and provenance, and [size review](2026-09-13-icon-size-review.html)
for light/dark previews. The old `output/specdown-icons` exploration kit is not
the source of truth for the normalized assets.

## Build

Run `npm run build`, then `npm run desktop` for the local Electron app. For iOS, run `xcodegen generate` in `ios/`, then build the SpecDown scheme in Xcode. Existing installed applications do not gain this feature until rebuilt/reinstalled or updated.
