# CLAUDE.md — AI Working Instructions for SpecDown

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session.
It captures project conventions so any AI assistant can pick up context quickly.

<!-- test: verify version-bump pipeline -->

## Project Overview

**SpecDown** is a lightweight markdown viewer with interactive Mermaid diagram support.
It has two surfaces that share the same `markdown-viewer/` codebase:

- **Web app** — deployed to GitHub Pages (`cbremer.github.io/specdown`)
- **Desktop app** — Electron wrapper distributed as a macOS `.dmg`

## Docs Conventions

All documentation lives under `docs/`. Each project gets its own subdirectory:

```
docs/
├── project-desktop/       ← current
└── project-desktop-v2/    ← future example
```

Files inside a project folder follow this naming pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-<type>-<detail>.md
```

**Types:**
- `brainstorm` — pre-code exploration, problem framing, framework comparisons
- `spec` — technical specification (version new files for major revisions, e.g. `spec-desktop-v2.md`)
- `tasks` — session-level implementation checklists (one file per working session, numbered)

**Examples:**
```
2026-02-20-brainstorm-desktop-electron.md
2026-02-21-spec-desktop-v1.md
2026-02-21-tasks-session-01-electron-shell.md
2026-02-28-tasks-session-02-native-file-open.md   ← next session would look like this
```

Each project folder has a `README.md` that serves as the entry point with:
- What the project is
- A timeline table linking all docs
- Current status
- The naming conventions for that project

When starting a new session, **add a tasks file** with the next session number and update the timeline table in the project's `README.md`.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev               # Vite dev server for the web app (hot reload)
npm run build             # Vite production build → markdown-viewer/dist/
npm run preview           # serve the production build locally
npm test                  # run full Jest suite (required before committing)
npm run test:coverage     # coverage report
npm run lint              # ESLint (flat config) — must be clean before committing
npm run format            # Prettier — write
npm run desktop           # build the web app, then launch Electron (macOS)
npm run desktop:build     # build the web app + .dmg locally (macOS only)
```

The shared web app is a Vite + ES-module build. All three surfaces (web, desktop,
iOS) load the build output in `markdown-viewer/dist/`, so `npm run build` must
run before packaging the desktop or iOS app (the `desktop`/`desktop:build`
scripts and the CI workflows do this for you).

Tests and lint must pass before committing; both run in CI on every PR
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Coverage is reported by `npm run test:coverage`
but no hard `coverageThreshold` is configured in `package.json` yet.

---

## Release Pipeline

Merging to `main` triggers an automated sequence:

1. **Version bump** — `npm version patch` creates a commit + git tag (e.g. `v0.0.48`)
2. **DMG build** — macOS GitHub Actions runner builds and packages the `.dmg`
3. **GitHub Release** — DMG attached to a release matching the new tag
4. **Web deploy** — GitHub Pages updated simultaneously

Do not manually push version tags. Let the pipeline handle it.

## Git & Branch Conventions

- Feature branches: `claude/<short-description>-<session-id>`
- Always push with `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Never push directly to `main` or `master`
- Never use `--no-verify` to skip hooks
